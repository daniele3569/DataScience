Data Normalizaiton

Uniform the feutures value with different range
E.g
Not-normalized
Age Income
20    100000
30     20000
40    500000

Not-normalized
Agen and imcome are in different range
Hard to compare
Income will influence the result more

Normalized
Age Income
0.20    0.2
0.30    0.04
0.40    1

Both variables are normalized in ranges from 0-1
Similar value range
similar intirnsic influence on analytical model


Methods of noemalizing
1)  Simple Feature scaling
Xnew= Xold / Xmax

WITH Pandas
df["length"] = df["length"] / df["length"].max()

2)  Min-Max
Xnew= Xold - Xmin / Xmax - Xmin
WITH Pandas
df["length"] = (df["length"] - df["length"].min() )/ (df["length"].max() - df["length"].min() )

3) Z-score
Xnew = Xold - U / O
Where U: Miu is the average of the feature
and O : Zigma is the standard deviation

WITH Pandas
df["length"] = (df["length"] - df["length"].mean() )/  df["length"].std()
