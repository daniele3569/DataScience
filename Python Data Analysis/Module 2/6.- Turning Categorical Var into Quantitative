Most statistical models cannot take in the objects/strings as inputs

e.g.
CAR   FUEL
A      gas
B      diesel
C      gas
D      gas

Solution:
Add dummy variables for each unique category
Assing 0 or 1 in each category
THIS TECHNIQUE IS CALLED "ONE-HOT ENCODING"

CAR   FUEL      gas    diesel
A      gas       1      0
B      diesel    0      1
C      gas       1      0
D      gas       1      0

Dummy variables in Pythib ppandas
Use pandas.get_dumies() method
Convert categorical variables to dummy variables (0 or 1)

pd.get_dummies(df['fuel'])
