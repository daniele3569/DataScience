##PEARSON CORRELATION##

*Measure the strength of the correlation between two features
    *Correlation coefficeint
    *P-value

*Correlation coefficient
    *Close to +1: Large Positive relationship
    *Close to -1: Large Negative relationship
    *Close to 0: No relationship

*P-Value
    *P-value <0.001 Strong certainty in the result
    *P-value <0.05 Moderate certainty in the result
    *P-value <0.1 Weak certainty in the result
    *P-value >0.1 No certainty in the result

*Strong correlation
    *Correlation coefficient close to 1 or -1
    * P value less than 0.001


E.G
pearson_coef, p_value= stats.pearsonr(df['horsepower'], df['price'])

- Pearson correlation: 0.81 (positve correlation)
- P-value: 9.35 e-48  (much smaller than 0.001 , strong correlation )
