Example output for df.describe():
Letâ€™s say you have a dataset of ages, and df.describe() outputs the following:

text
Copy
count    1000.000000
mean       35.478900
std        12.345678
min        18.000000
25%        25.000000
50%        35.000000
75%        45.000000
max        60.000000
Count: 1000 non-null values.

Mean: The average age is about 35.48 years.

Std: The ages deviate from the mean by roughly 12.35 years.

Min: The youngest age in the dataset is 18.

25% (Q1): 25% of the ages are below 25.

50% (Median): The median age is 35.

75% (Q3): 75% of the ages are below 45.

Max: The oldest age in the dataset is 60.

In summary:
The statistics retrieved by df.describe() give you:

An understanding of central tendency (mean, median).

Insights into data spread and variability (standard deviation, min, max, quartiles).

A good overview of the distribution of your data.

If your data is numeric, describe() is a powerful tool to get a quick sense of its characteristics! Let me know if you have more questions or need further details!


However, what if you would also like to check all the columns including those that are of type object?


You can add an argument include = "all" inside the bracket. Try it again.
